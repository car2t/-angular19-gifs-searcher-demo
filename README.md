# Angular Gifs Searcher Demo App

Angular 19 application to search gifs.

Final project of section 8 of **Dev/Talles' course: Angular 2025**.

## Use Notes: 

- **PLEASEEEEEE be careful with the scroll in the Trending Page because I am only allowed 100 requests / 1 h. ;D** 
  Just scroll a bit and you will see how infinite scroll works. The scroll is persistent.

- You can use search input to find gifs. Those queries will be storage in _LocalStorage_ and it will appear in the sidebar. 
So you could take a look again those gifs just clicking those queries in the sidebar list. 

- Other principal app's feature is click on _Trending_ button to check most popular gifs.
